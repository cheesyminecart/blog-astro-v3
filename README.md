# The Spacer

The Spacer is a blog. What else can I really say?

Moving back to being serious, we're a group of high schoolers who've taken a liking to space and STEM in general! Much of our articles are done to condense research papers into a format for the layman, encouraging young people to take up this subject, as they should.

No more shall the doctor be the crown jewel of overbearing parents!

description: Reviewing Iron Lung, a critically-acclaimed retro horror game set in the far future!
---

I'm a space nerd, that's become a non-negotiable facet of my life. This means that I shove my opinions about a new probe, telescope or whatnot in everybody's faces given the opportunity. Every living moment of my life has been spent on a quest seeking the one space-themed video game. The one space-themed video game without glaring issues, great graphics and the ability to make even the harshest critics hold bouquets of flowers. However, I haven't been as lucky - each game has its own flaws, may it be hawkish business models or unpolished mechanics.

This, however, has never discouraged the search for the gold standard of space games. I think I've found the perfect game - Iron Lung, which has captivated the likes of many others. Created by David Szymanski, many critics of the game have praised the game's unique atmosphere, depth and worldbuilding techniques.

However, I'm a sucker for horror games, and I can't bring myself to spend money on a game that'll take me only about an hour to complete (it's 35 HKD on steam). What better than to get a friend to play the game for me instead?

Right from the beginning you're shown a text-based spinoff of the far future - an event known as "The Quiet Rapture" has whisked all sentient life, stars, galaxies or anything that could've created life to who knows where, replacing them with a motley collection of lunar objects, some containing oceans of human blood. This has forced remaining humans on space stations to scavenge for ever-dwindling resources, with inter-space station conflicts commonplace and bloody. You're a submarine pilot/ex-convict meant to explore one of these blood oceans in exchange for your freedom, which means you'll be hopping around points of interest in a deep trench, shooting photos in a submarine not meant for such pressures. How delighting!

As the player, you're able to navigate this apocalyptic world through a terminal embedded in the side of your submarine. This genius addition provides a third party that highlights the bleak circumstances you're thrust into as the player. In addition, your ability to see forwards is sealed shut, as the pressure outside is too high for the submarine window to withstand and must therefore be bolted shut. You're reliant on a radar the entire game, using a map and a proximity alert system to guide you - and one little brush-up with the walls of the trench will cause a cascade structural failure leading to your death. The added component of knowing that you are surrounded by certain death at all times really adds to the suspense - it's what makes this two-hour long game such a teeth-chattering experience!

Throughout the game, a bunch of psychological tricks serve to unsettle you - the use of a blood ocean not only compounds an innate lingering thalassophobia within the human psyche but also highlights the disturbing, post-apocalyptic world Szymanski masterfully crafts. In addition, the added touch of the submarine slowly crumbling around you adds more psychological horror to your experience - fires break out, oxygen runs low, low-poly textured blood fills your capsule - the makings of a great night!

I'd recommend it to anyone, especially the faint of heart - it's always great to try out different genres of games! Though 'faint of heart' here deliberately avoids those afflicted with heart diseases, it's a great game that'll have you quivering in your boots the entire way. If you're wondering how my friend did, by the fourth 'point of interest' he was having to take long, drawn-out music breaks. Just a bad omen, nothing special to look at!

Besides, somewhere in the void, there must be hope...

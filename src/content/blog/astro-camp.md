**Astronomy - the solitary hobby. Only if you let it be, though!**

I've been taking astrophotographs for the past 4 months, mostly as a motivator for space. Regardless of the numerous equipment failures and cloud-covered nights I've seen, it's been one of the best choices I've ever made. I'd even signed up for astronomy camps - though often times, the weather would be cloudy.

That's when I wondered: _Could I make my own astronomy camp?_

Where I'm from, this is almost unheard of - light pollution here makes the sky shine at an ambient magnitude of 10, making it almost impossible to see anything other than the moon and some planets. It's absolutely terrible knowing that kids here have to go almost 2 hours out just to see stars - which the local pace of life these days doesn't permit.

I went ahead with the idea anyways. Friends were invited, plans changed, and we all decided on one rooftop (of the many) to rest my scope and camera on.

The plan was to let others take photos of the moon - the most beginner-friendly, All the while, I'd be taking my own photos of Jupiter, the second hurdle for any planetary photographer. Setting up, focusing and taking some daytime lunar images took around 45 minutes. The sun was setting, the sky grew darker, everything was in place.

With the perfect setting came the imperfect execution. My ASIAIR was acting up - for some reason, there just wasn't anything in the live video feed, forcing me to take photos one by one. In hindsight, setting the exposure time to microseconds wasn't the best idea.

During the three hours I was there, I was able to get around 112 photos of Jupiter. With post-processing, I could make out details within the bands, though the colours needed some work. Regardless, the moon photos turned out pretty well - they were really clear, especially for first-timers.

It's been the highlight of my life to have been able to host this, and I'm honoured to have a devoted cast of friends come over. The city growing quieter with every minute, on a dark rooftop with friends, taking pictures of far flung planets - even if I'd thought I failed that night, it kept me going.

Running a local astronomy club might seem difficult, daunting - especially when the hobby is considered solitary by many. Living in a city synonymous with light pollution, fluorescent-orange city lights tend to stifle any semblance of well-developed astronomy education, so it can be difficult to convince others to go, especially if

# About the Author

Hi, I'm Julien, and I'm interested in all sorts of things. This website is dedicated primarily to a lot of the things I find 'fun', such as learning about astronomy, dungeons and dragons, and much more!

As of now, I'm a high-schooler studying in Hong Kong, trying to survive the IB. As a result, there might be a bit of a 'gradient' in the quality of each article, and articles written closer to test dates may not also be of the highest quality. I tend not to take it too seriously though - if I'm overwhelmed, I'll just wait until I'm in the frame of mind to proofread effectively. This site, along with my other one, has gone on for 3-ish years by this point, and it has been pivotal in my becoming more confident in my writing ability.

Also, I'm open to any article suggestions - so long as I haven't heard about it. This website, much like the one below, is meant to serve as documentation for what I have learned during my life.

Outside of scientific writing and the hobbies I've specified above, I like to swim and do various water sports, like diving. I'm also quite protective of my taste in music - absolutely adore Pendulum's music! Lately, I've been experimenting with Jack London's style of descriptive writing - one day, I hope to be able to write my very own space opera series! Am a bit of an amateur worldbuilder at that.

## Mindniche

In addition to this website, I've got another writing project of mine - namely, [MindNiche](https://mindniche.org). Feel free to check it out - though it should be noted that the website isn't ready to receive guest writers - yet.

Essentially, what happened was that I opened the site to guest writers - and it fell through. I wasn't very good at running a team because I made too many concessions, and writing large volumes of educational can be difficult when you're overwhelmed.

So instead, I'm hoping that I can 'mould' the site through

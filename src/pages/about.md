A very, very hastily constructed blog!

# About the Author

Hi, I'm Julien, and I'm interested in all sorts of things. This website is dedicated primarily to a lot of the things I find 'fun', such as learning about astronomy, dungeons and dragons, and much more! Alongside with writing, I like to scuba dive, do astronomy and swim in my free time.

I'm open to any article suggestions - so long as I haven't heard about it. This website, much like the one below, is meant to serve as documentation for what I have learned during my life.

# My Other Projects

Aside from this blog, I've also got other things I tend to spend my time on! Below are the **two main writing projects** I am working on:

## MindNiche

In addition to this website, I've got another writing project of mine - namely, [MindNiche](https://mindniche.org). Feel free to check it out - though the website isn't ready to receive guest writers yet.

Essentially, what happened was that I opened the site to guest writers - and it fell through. I wasn't very good at running a team because I made too many concessions, and writing large volumes of educational can be difficult when you're overwhelmed. The plan for the future is, however, to reopen it such that I have an editorial system instead of multiple writers, because this way, I'll learn faster.

So for now, this site will act as a reflection of what I currently know. There are roughly 130,000 words of material on the website as of writing this description, ranging from content about astronomy to relativity. (March 2025).

## Solar Schism - My Custom TTRPG World!

In addition, I'm developing a custom world for my DND campaign! Having been deeply involved in my school's Dungeons and Dragons clubs, I have been able to gain valuable experience in communicating through acting as a DM. It has encouraged me to develop my own world.

Called "Solar Schism", it is the prequel to the "Falling Stars" world, set in the late-22nd century in a Solar System threatening to tear itself apart. As the next generation of pioneers, you and your party, coming from disparate backgrounds, all share the same goal - to survive the coming schism between the powers of the Solar System. A short post detailing my world and a little bit of background will be put on this website, but I'm still hoping to separate the two.

You can see the odd post about it on this blog - but if I do update it, it'll be sporadic.

## Miscellaneous

Along with these, here's a list of the things I'm working on / have worked on:

### Physics and Astronomy Competitions

- IAAC 2023 Hong Kong National Award
- BPhO 2023 Bronze 1 Award
- BPhO 2023 Online SPC Gold
- BPhO SPC China Marathon Diamond Award
- Sir Isaac Newton Distinction

### Research

- In the Summer of 2024, I was a research intern at the Hong Kong University Laboratory for Space Research (HKU-LSR) where I worked under Dr. Andreas Ritter to model planetary nebulae using SHAPEX.
